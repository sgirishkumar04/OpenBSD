A comprehensive, single-page educational website dedicated to exploring the core concepts of the **OpenBSD** operating system. This project goes beyond static information by including two interactive JavaScript simulators to visually demonstrate complex OS topics: **CPU Scheduling (SRTF)** and **Process Synchronization**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Comprehensive OpenBSD Information:** Detailed sections covering OpenBSD's unique features, core commands, system calls, and more, complete with comparisons to Linux.
-   **Interactive SRTF Scheduling Simulator:** A hands-on tool to understand the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling algorithm. Users can:
    -   Add processes with custom arrival and burst times.
    -   Visualize the CPU timeline as the algorithm executes.
    -   Automatically calculate and display Completion, Waiting, and Turnaround times for each process, along with the averages.
-   **Process Synchronization Simulator:** A visual representation of a producer-consumer problem (themed as an Akshaya Centre queue) to demonstrate synchronization concepts. It simulates:
    -   A shared, limited resource (the chairs in the queue).
    -   Mutual exclusion, ensuring only one customer is "processed" at a time.
    -   Status updates for waiting, processing, and queue-full states.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This is a pure front-end project built with fundamental web technologies, making it lightweight and universally compatible.

-   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the webpage.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):** For all the logic powering the interactive SRTF and Synchronization simulators. No external frameworks or libraries were used.

## üí° Project Purpose

This website was developed as a project for our Operating Systems course. The primary goal was to not only research and present information about a unique OS like OpenBSD but also to actively demonstrate our understanding of core OS concepts through the creation of interactive, from-scratch simulators.
